                    <li>The OnePlus Nord CE 5G price starts at Rs. 22,999 in India for the base variant which has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The mid-spec variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage is priced at Rs. 24,999, while the top-of-the-line 12GB RAM, 256GB storage variant is priced at Rs. 27,999.

                        All three variants are available in the dark Charcoal Ink finish. The 8GB variant is also available in a Blue Void colour. If you choose the 12GB RAM version, you can choose between these two as well as an exclusive Silver Ray option. I have the top-spec variant in Blue Void for this review.The OnePlus Nord CE 5G is a good-looking device and reminds me of the original Nord, especially in the Blue Void colour. It is solidly built and feels comfortable to hold. OnePlus has managed to keep the phone slim at 7.9mm in thickness, and it weighs 170g which feels lighter than some of the other smartphones I've tested recently. The Nord CE 5G is well balanced and it is curved along the sides which makes it comfortable to grip.

                        The OnePlus Nord CE 5G managed to capture some good photos in daylight, and these looked very good on the AMOLED display. It also managed to capture good details of objects in the foreground and text was legible at 100 percent magnification. The ultra-wide angle camera offers a wider field of view but there's a noticeable drop in image quality. The sides of photos also appeared warped.</li>

                    <li>You get a big 6.43-inch display with a camera hole in the top left corner. The bezels are thin around the sides and top while the chin is slightly larger. The frame of the Nord CE 5G is made out of plastic and all the buttons are placed near the centre. The power button is on the right and volume buttons are on the left. This placement makes it easy to reach these buttons without needing to shuffle the phone in the hand. However, there's no alert slider, which has become a OnePlus trademark over the years. The SIM tray is on the left as well and can take in two Nano-SIMs but there's no microSD card slot.

                        The Nord CE 5G does have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which was missing on the OnePlus Nord (Review). It's at the bottom along with the USB Type-C port and loudspeaker. Turn the phone around and there are only two elements there; a OnePlus logo in the centre and the triple camera module in the top-left corner. The camera module does protrude slightly but this isn't a major issue. My Blue Void review unit had a matte finish at the back which made it resist fingerprints quite well.
                        
                        Just like the OnePlus Nord, the Nord CE 5G sports some interesting specifications for its asking price. The big 6.43-inch AMOLED display has full-HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate which is a big plus. It also has an in-display fingerprint scanner and Asahi Dragontrail glass for protection. Powering the OnePlus Nord CE 5G is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor, which we have seen in some of the competition such as the Xiaomi Mi 10i (Review) and Samsung Galaxy M42 5G (Review). You get 6GB of RAM on the base variant of the Nord CE 5G, and a whopping 12GB RAM on the range-topping one that I had for review.</li>
