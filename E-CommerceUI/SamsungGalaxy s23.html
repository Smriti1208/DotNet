                    <li>The base Galaxy S model from Samsung has enjoyed the privilege of being the only compact Android flagship in India for the past few years. However, things are different now as Google showed up out of nowhere and decided to bring its premium Pixel smartphones to India. </li>

                    <li>The Samsung Galaxy S23 is also capable of shooting 8K video. While it's not as detailed as the footage captured from the Galaxy S23 Ultra, it does a good job at it and manages a steady bitrate. However, do keep in mind that 8K recordings take up a lot of storage space.The picture shows the quality of camera.</li>

                    <li>The Samsung Galaxy S23 is available in four finishes and two configurations. There's Phantom Black, Cream, Green, and Lavender finishes to choose from. The two storage variants include the base variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage which is available at Rs. 74,999, while the second variant with 256GB of storage is priced at Rs. 79,999. I received the Lavender unit with 256GB of storage for review.</li>

                    <li>  Similar to its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S23 offers a 6.1-inch full-HD+ Super AMOLED display with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and a touch sampling rate of 240Hz. The fingerprint reader is embedded in the display and is quite reliable. Just like the Galaxy S23 Ultra, Samsung offers the same customised “Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy” SoC in the Galaxy S23.</li>
