                    <li>Some of the features of the Nothing Phone 1 that really stand out are its premium build quality, vibrant display, good primary camera, and clean Android experience. The glyph lights are a nice differentiator but you may or may not find them actually useful for daily use. The one thing that needs the most improvement right now is the secondary cameras, especially in low light. Video recording could also benefit from better stabilisation and features.
                        The Nothing Phone 1 was a mid-range smartphone and it launched with an appropriate pricing. The Nothing Phone 2 is positioned more as a â€˜value flagship' and is priced higher. It starts at Rs. 44,999 in India for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, followed by a Rs. 49,999 variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There's a third variant this time with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, priced at Rs. 54,999. It's rare to see this much storage outside of premium flagships which tend to cost over a lakh rupees, with the only other exception being the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G which has a 1TB storage variant for Rs. 30,000.

                    <li>The glass back of the Nothing Phone 2 features rounded edges which make it feels a bit nicer to hold. All the components and wiring beneath the transparent back are neatly hidden away by panels, with only a few Torx screws visible. Pulling off a transparent body isn't easy, and once again Nothing has outdone itself.
                        The display of the Nothing Phone 2 has similar specs as that of the Phone 1, apart from a few notable upgrades. It's larger now at 6.7 inches and features an LTPO AMOLED panel which can vary the refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz, which in theory, should help squeeze out better battery life. The outdoor screen brightness is now 1,000 nits and in HDR video playback, it can reach up to 1,600 nits (1,200 nits on Phone 1). The display also has a centred cutout for the selfie camera and the bezels around it are slightly narrower compared to the Phone 1.
